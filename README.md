# python-csv-splitter
Split your csv file into 6 files with python

File Splitter Script
This Python script reads a CSV file and splits it into six separate files with an equal number of rows.

# Usage
- Ensure that you have Python and pandas installed.
- Save the script to your desired directory.
- Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
- Set the input file name and output file prefix by modifying the variables input_file and output_prefix.
- Run the script by executing python file_splitter.py.
- The script will split the input file into six separate files, each with a name of the form <output_prefix>i.csv, where i is an integer from 1 to 6. The number of rows per file is determined automatically, ensuring that each file has an equal number of rows (except for the last file, which may have fewer rows).
